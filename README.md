# Ruby Stack

A stack data structure implemented in ruby, using TDD and RSpec.

## Setup

I use Vagrant and Ansible to set up my development environment, but it is not necessary to do so in this case. You just need the following software installed:

- Ruby 2.2.1
- RSpec 3.2.0

## Implementation notes

In order to better show the TDD process, I made a commit after every test and after every implementation.
